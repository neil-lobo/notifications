# WIP

## Platforms
- twitch (irc connection integrated into this service)
- discord (via webhook)
- Custom HTTP

For now, platform configs are loadded statically from json. Plan to move to dynamic edits stored in db in the future
Just want to get MVP for service and client first, then flesh out features
